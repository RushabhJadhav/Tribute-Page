        He was an American-born French singer-songwriter, born in New York City
        to American film directore Jules Dassin (1911-2008) A New York born
        violinist, who after graduating from a Hebrew Hight School in the Bronx
        studied with the British violinist Harold Berkely at the Julliard School
        of Music.

        Joe lived in New York until 1940, and only then moved to Los Angeles.
        Despite the good financial situation of the family, the boy began to
        earn extra money already at a young age. He spent his free time with his
        beloved younger sisters, and also was fond of reading. His first
        earnings, Joe Dassin spent on the purchase of the American universal
        encyclopedia Britannica, subsequently buying up all his volumes.

        In 1951, Joe Dassin went to continue his studies in Italy, two years
        later, to Geneva, and soon received a bachelor's degree in Grenoble.
        Throughout the years of training, Joe was able to freely master three
        languages, loved swimming and skiing.

        Joe was one of France's most popular singers during the late '60s and
        '70s, initially building his name with stylized adaptations of folk and
        country material from his birthplace. As his career blossomed, Dassin
        turned increasingly to traditional-style chansons penned by some of the
        genre's best writers, scoring an all-time classic with his 1975 smash
        "L'Eté Indien." Notorious for his perfectionism, Dassin could play the
        introverted romantic, but his persona also played off of American
        archetypes and imagery. His premature death of a heart attack in 1980
        robbed French pop of one of its greatest modern-day practitioners.
        Joseph Ira Dassin was born November 7, 1938, in New York City.
